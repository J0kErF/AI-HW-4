# PROMPTS — AI-assisted development log (Prompt Book)

> Version **1.00** · V3 §8.3. Documents how this project was built *with* AI
> agents — the prompts, context, and reasoning. HW1 feedback explicitly flagged
> that this development narrative was missing; it is itself a graded deliverable.

## How to use this log
Append one entry per significant prompt/iteration. Keep it honest: include
prompts that *failed* and what was changed.

---

### P0.1 — Project initialization (this scaffold)
- **Context given to the agent:** EX04 assignment PDF, L07 lecture summary,
  the Graphify "how to read a graph" deck, V3 submission guidelines, HW1 detailed
  feedback, and the HW1/HW2/HW3 repositories for house-style.
- **Goal:** stand up the full HW4 infrastructure docs-first (PRD→PLAN→TODO→code
  stubs) before any implementation, per V3 §2.5.
- **Key decisions surfaced to the user:** base repo (BugsInPy), agent framework
  (LangGraph), project name (`graphquest`).
- **Outcome:** directory tree, versioned config, SDK/Gatekeeper/services skeleton
  (≤150 LOC, pre-split), and all `docs/` written; `version`+`config` implemented
  with passing tests.
- **What changed mid-flight:** read the Graphify PDF *before* writing
  `PRD_graphify.md` so the `graph.json`/`hot.md`/`index.md` schemas match the
  taught conventions (evidence types, confidence, source_file) instead of being
  invented blind.

### P1.1 — Acquire & pin the target bug
- **Context given:** EX04 + L07 + V3; live BugsInPy metadata inspected via the
  GitHub API (cookiecutter & thefuck bug lists, `bug.info`, `run_test.sh`,
  `bug_patch.txt`).
- **Goal:** pick one reproducible bug; implement `clone_target()` with offline,
  mockable tests; reproduce the codebase.
- **Decision & why:** flipped primary from `thefuck` to **cookiecutter bug 2** —
  cross-platform reproducible, and its root cause spans `run_hook`→`find_hook`
  (a changed return contract) for a stronger graph-navigation demo; also exhibits
  a docstring-vs-code gap. Fallback bug 1; thefuck kept as larger alternative.
- **Outcome:** `acquire` service (`BugInfo` / `bug_metadata` parser /
  `TargetCheckout` with injected runner) + `SDK.clone_target()`; metadata vendored
  into `config/setup.json` (no run-time network dependency); buggy commit cloned
  into `data/target_repo` and the defect confirmed at source.
- **Honesty note:** full pytest reproduction (needs cookiecutter deps in an
  isolated venv) deferred to a Phase-4 prerequisite; source-level defect verified.

### P2.1 — Graphify deterministic pipeline
- **Context given:** the Graphify "reading a graph" spec (Node=entity, Edge=claim
  with evidence type + confidence + source_file; Code/Semantic layers); the
  reproduced cookiecutter checkout.
- **Goal:** build the token-free graph + Obsidian vault from real source.
- **Outcome:** `ast_visitor` (per-file facts) + `CodeLayer` (module/class/function
  nodes; imports/inherits/calls/tested_by EXTRACTED edges, conservative unique-name
  resolution) + `MetricsCalculator` (NetworkX degree/betweenness/communities/
  bridges/God-nodes) + `VaultWriter` + `ReportWriter` + `Graphifier` + `graphify`
  CLI/SDK. Ran on cookiecutter → 459 nodes / 390 edges; the bug-relevant
  `run_hook→find_hook` and `test_find_hook→find_hook` edges are present.
- **Iteration / what failed:** a Jinja-template `.py` test fixture broke
  `ast.parse`; fixed by skipping unparseable files (they aren't real source).
- **Decision:** NetworkX is installed, so used it for real graph theory (rather
  than a pure-Python fallback). Semantic layer + Gatekeeper deferred to the agent
  phase (need an LLM key); deterministic graph is complete and token-free.
- **Quality:** 17 tests pass; ruff clean; coverage 77% (gap is Phase 3-5 stubs).

### P3.1 — Reverse-engineering diagrams + insights
- **Context given:** EX04 §5.2 (block diagram + OOP schema *from the graph*); the
  real cookiecutter `graph.json`.
- **Outcome:** `DiagramGenerator` (Mermaid `flowchart` of modules grouped by dir;
  `classDiagram` from class+inherits edges) + `ReverseEngineeringReport`
  (auto God-node insight from betweenness + the `find_hook` docstring-vs-code gap)
  + `SDK.reverse_engineer` + `reverse` CLI. Ran on cookiecutter → renders the
  `CookiecutterException` hierarchy (17 inherits) and both insights.
- **Quality:** 20 tests pass (diagrams 100%, report 92%); ruff clean; coverage 78%.

### P4.0 — API Gatekeeper (Phase 4 prerequisite)
- **Context given:** V3 §5 (single chokepoint; rate limit from config; queue/
  backpressure; retries; token/cost ledger; budget cap).
- **Outcome:** `RateLimiter` (sliding-window, blocks on limit, injected clock/
  sleep) + `ApiGatekeeper` (execute with rate-limit→budget→retry→record; pricing
  from config; `BudgetExceededError`). Fully offline-tested (mock call, virtual
  clock — no waits/network); gatekeeper 97%, limiter 100%.
- **Note:** the live debugging agent + token benchmark (Phases 4-5) need a real
  LLM key in `.env`; the machinery and budget accounting are ready.
